## Setting Up Your Environment

### Step 1: GitHub Copilot License

Check with your organization to see if you have a GitHub Copilot license available.

If you do not have a license, you can sign up for a trial [here](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup).

### Step 2: Setting Up Your IDE

**OPTION 1: Use your local computer**

The following IDEs are supported for GitHub Copilot:

- VSCode (Recommended)
- Visual Studio
- NeoVIM
- JetBrains IDE

You can choose the IDE that suits your preference and install it on your local machine.

### Step 3: Install GitHub Copilot Extension

Install the GitHub Copilot extension for your chosen IDE:

- **VSCode**: [Install VSCode Extension](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot?tool=vscode#installing-the-visual-studio-code-extension)
- **Visual Studio**: [Install Visual Studio Extension](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot?tool=visualstudio#installing-the-visual-studio-extension)

**OPTION 2: Use CodeSpaces**

CodeSpaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to develop entirely in the cloud. You can use CodeSpaces to complete the exercises without installing any software on your local machine. Check with your organization if you have access to CodeSpaces and confirm if the lab exercises are supported in CodeSpaces.

You can find more information on how to use CodeSpaces [here](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart).

### Step 4: Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork the Repository**: Navigate to the exercise repository and fork it to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git. If you are using CodeSpaces, you can open the repository directly in CodeSpaces.
3. **Open in IDE**: Open the cloned repository in your chosen IDE.
4. **Enable GitHub Copilot**: Ensure the GitHub Copilot extension is enabled and sign in to your GitHub account if required. Check the status bar in your IDE to confirm that GitHub Copilot is active.
