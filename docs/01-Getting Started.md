## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Setting Up Your Environment

### Step 1: GitHub Copilot License

    Check with your organization to see if you have a GitHub Copilot license available.

    If you do not have a license, you can sign up for a trial [here](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup).

### Step 2: Setting Up Your IDE

    **OPTION 1: Use your local computer**

    The following IDEs are supported for GitHub Copilot:

    - VSCode (Recommended)
    - Visual Studio
    - NeoVIM
    - JetBrains IDE

    You can choose the IDE that suits your preference and install it on your local machine.

**OPTION 2: Use CodeSpaces**

CodeSpaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to develop entirely in the cloud. You can use CodeSpaces to complete the exercises without installing any software on your local machine.

Check with your organization if you have access to CodeSpaces and confirm if the lab exercises are supported in CodeSpaces.

You can find more information on how to use CodeSpaces here - https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart
